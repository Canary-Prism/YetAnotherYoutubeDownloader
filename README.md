Youtube Downloader but good

Do you like having to pay for Youtube Premium? Do you like using crappy internet Youtube Donloaders that send you a virus link everytime you move a pixel of ur mouse? if you say no to both, Welcome to YetAnotherYoutubeDownloader!! The concept is simple. i don't know how to make a youtube downloader, therefore i'm piggybacking off of others' work and just provide a user interface to handle all the bs that those crappy youtube downloaders have to offer, and just simplify it to:
1. enter your video url
2. wait a bit
3. ???
4. profit

### [Download](https://github.com/Rex-tc/RotationCalendarGenerator/releases/)

I'm assuming you know how to use GitHub. If not then here:

### Download Steps

1. Click above link
2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section
4. Click the "RotationCalendarGeneratorx.y.z.jar" file

### Notice

This program uses Java, you should download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven't already to run this

#### [Here's a handy link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

(yes ik it should only need jre if it's compiled but idk how i managed to screw up my code so much that you still need jdk but here we are. If you manage to get this working with jre only plz tell me how and you will have earned the right to call me moron 20 times)
